# Vinnie's fancy String Calculator front-end
Using: 
- React
- TS
- Tailwind
- ShadcnUI
- Vite
- Cypress
- Vercel
- pnpm

Also: `vite-tsconfig-paths` to allow Vite to read tsconfig compiler option paths (so I don't need to define custom path resolution twice)

https://learn.cypress.io/tutorials/running-our-tests-with-github-actions along with https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/issues/1144 to deal with using pnpm as my package manager (doh)
